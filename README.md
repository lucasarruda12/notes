# About naming consistency

- Naming conventions changed a lot between the first and current versions of my class notes. I do not plan on going back and fixing them.

- The idea i have at the moment is trying to do aula#.md and relying on the created-at date (or maybe the commit date?) for knowing when that class was held.
