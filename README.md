# About

I use Vim and Markdown to take notes during my college classes, and I manage them with Git/GitHub. Recently, I started hosting them on GitHub Pages for easier access.

I don't think this repository will be useful to anyone but myself, but GitHub asks for either money or a public repository. Since I don't have the former, I'm going with the latter.
